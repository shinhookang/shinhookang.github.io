The ability of numerical modeling to replicate nature has always interested me. To learn more about the mathematical modeling, I worked a researcher in South Korea before starting my Ph.D. For the first two years, I analyzed ground-based and satellite observation data and produced a good initial condition for numerical weather prediction model using data assimilation methods at the National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp). After that, I participated in the development of a next-generation numerical weather prediction system at the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems [KIAPS](https://www.kiaps.org/en/main.do). My desire to understand more about numerical methods and mechanics led me to study abroad to pursue my Ph.D. To successfully handle the numerical challenges arising from mantle convection and atmospheric flows, I explored high-order methods and operator splitting techniques for my Ph.D. thesis, which was carried out under the supervision of Professor Tan Bui-Thanh at the University of Texas at Austin [UT](https://www.ae.utexas.edu). I also studied the use of a nonconforming mesh and sliding mesh interface for targeting wind turbine simulations. Since graduation, I have worked at Argonne National Laboratory [ANL](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) as a postdoctoral appointee. During my postdoctoral period, I have focused on developing stable coupling methods for an Earth system model from a time integrator perspective. Currently, I am actively working on subgrid-scale modeling using machine learning methods.
 
 <!-- I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a PhD in Engineering Mechanics in 2019. I formerly worked as a research scientist with the National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp) and the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems [KIAPS](https://www.kiaps.org/en/main.do). -->

My most recent project involved using machine learning to enhance a one-dimensional convection diffusion equation, Burgers equation, and chaotic system. I plan to complete this project by extending it to a multi-dimensional model. Additionally, I plan to improve the current coupling strategy to a high-order accurate model.
