I am a postdoctoral Appointee at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory. I completed my PhD in Engineering Mechanics (2019) from University of Texas at Austin. Previously, 
I was a research scientist in Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems(KIAPS) and National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp).

I focus on computational mechanics, in particular, high-order numerical methods for partial differential equations including atmospheric flows and mantle convection are of interest. 

## Recent news:

* November 2020: [A scalable exponential-DG approach for nonlinear conservation laws: with application to Burger and Euler equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01316) is submitted. 

<!-- ## Research Highlights:

This includes implicit-explicit (IMEX), exponential integrators
scalable machine learning development for various problems in scientific computing. This includes, but is not limited to, data-driven closure modeling for practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications, data-science module development and integration for CFD codes, and surrogate modeling for advection-dominated problems. I am also associated with the DeepHyper project at Argonne for scalable asynchronous neural architecture and hyperparameter search for deep neural networks. -->
