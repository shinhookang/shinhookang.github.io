I am a postdoctoral Appointee at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory. I completed my PhD in Engineering Mechanics (2019) from University of Texas at Austin. Previously, 
I was a research scientist in Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems(KIAPS) and National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp).
I focus on computational mechanics including high-order numerical methods, machine learning, time integrations, and high-performance computing.
