<!-- The ability of numerical modeling to replicate nature has always interested me. To learn more about the mathematical modeling, I worked a researcher in South Korea before starting my Ph.D. For the first two years, I analyzed ground-based and satellite observation data and produced a good initial condition for numerical weather prediction model using data assimilation methods at the National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp). After that, I participated in the development of a next-generation numerical weather prediction system at the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems [KIAPS](https://www.kiaps.org/en/main.do). My desire to understand more about numerical methods and mechanics led me to study abroad to pursue my Ph.D. To successfully handle the numerical challenges arising from mantle convection and atmospheric flows, I explored high-order methods and operator splitting techniques for my Ph.D. thesis, which was carried out under the supervision of Professor Tan Bui-Thanh at the University of Texas at Austin [UT](https://www.ae.utexas.edu). I also studied the use of a nonconforming mesh and sliding mesh interface for targeting wind turbine simulations. Since graduation, I have worked at Argonne National Laboratory [ANL](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) as a postdoctoral appointee. During my postdoctoral period, I have focused on developing stable coupling methods for an Earth system model from a time integrator perspective. Currently, I am actively working on subgrid-scale modeling using machine learning methods. -->
 <!-- Postdoctoral Appointee (2019-Present), Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory -->
 Our group focuses on scientific machine learning, which combines the traditional computational mechanics and machine learning methods, for solving time-dependent partial differential equations arising from various scientific and engineering problems. We leverage cutting-edge techniques in scientific machine learning (SciML) to address time-dependent partial differential equations in complex scientific and engineering problems.

 <!-- Assistant professor (2024.3-Present), Department of Computer Convergence Software at Korea University Sejong Campus. -->
<!-- Specialist in Computational Mathematics (2023.8-Present), Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory -->

I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, followed by a Master of Engineering in Spatial Design and Engineering from Handong Global University, in 2007 and 2009 respectively. Then, I pursued and completed my Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin in 2019. 
After that, I dedicated about four years to working at Argonne National Laboratory.
In 2024, I started a new position as an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Convergence Software at Korea University Sejong Campus.
Details can be found in my [CV](../files/cv_shinhoo.pdf).

<!-- The ability of scientific computing to replicate nature has always interested me.
To learn more about the mathematical modeling, I worked a researcher in South Korea before starting my Ph.D. For the first two years (2010-2011), I analyzed ground-based and satellite observation data and produced a good initial condition for numerical weather prediction model using data assimilation methods at the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp). After that, I participated in the development of a next-generation numerical weather prediction system at the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems [KIAPS](https://www.kiaps.org/en/main.do). I was able to contribute to the development of the dynamical core that governs the atmospheric flows. My desire to understand more about numerical methods and mechanics led me to study abroad to pursue my Ph.D in 2014. To successfully handle the numerical challenges arising from mantle convection and atmospheric flows, I explored high-order methods and operator splitting techniques for my Ph.D. thesis, which was carried out under the supervision of Professor Tan Bui-Thanh. I also studied the use of a nonconforming mesh and sliding mesh interface for targeting wind turbine simulations. Since I graduated in 2019, I have worked at Argonne National Laboratory as a postdoctoral appointee for four years (2019-2023). During the early stage of my postdoctoral training, I have focused on developing stable coupling methods for an Earth system model from a time integrator perspective. Additionally, I invented the entropy stable time integrators for partitioned Runge-Kutta methods. 

Over the years, I have observed the growing importance of artificial intelligence(AI)/ machine learning (ML) in a variety of science and engineering problems, including Earth system modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and smart grid technologies. 
Indeed, AI/ML has become a mainstream and dominant research trend in recent years, and it has attracted substantial research funding across a wide range of domains and industries. To align my research with the rapidly evolving AI/ML techniques, I shifted my focus to subgrid-scale modeling using machine learning methods.
My most recent project involved to enhance a one-dimensional convection
diffusion equation, three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations, and chaotic system. -->
  
<!-- I am interested in a variety of applications for my future work, including geophysical flows, wind turbines, turbulent coolant flow, and plasma fluid. To this end, I will concentrate on three key aspects: high-order methods, high-performance computing, and machine learning. High-order methods are advantageous for parallel performance since they not only offer accurate numerical solutions but also have a small communication stencil. High-performance computing is essential for simulating large-scale phenomena. -->
