I am a postdoctoral Appointee at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory. I completed my PhD in Engineering Mechanics (2019) from University of Texas at Austin. Previously, 
I was a research scientist in Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems(KIAPS) and National Institute of Meteorological Research [NIMR](http://www.nims.go.kr/AE/MA/main.jsp).

I focus on computational mechanics, in particular, high-order numerical methods for partial differential equations including atmospheric flows and mantle convection. 

## Recent news:

* November 2020: [A scalable exponential-DG approach for nonlinear conservation laws: with application to Burger and Euler equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01316) is submitted.
